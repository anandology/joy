# Square Spiral

This is an interesting pattern generated by rotating and scaling down a square repeatedly.

<div class="example">

<!--INCLUDE src/square-spiral.py -->
```python
rectangle(w=300, h=300) | repeat(100, scale(0.92)|rotate(5))
```
<!-- ENDINCLUDE -->

<div class="output image"><img src="../images/square-spiral.svg"></div>

</div>

Do you think some curves in the image? Actually, there are no curves drawn. What you see are just the sides of squares.
